Topic is about the optimization of Tracking Area List design in LTE networks,
so that to reduce the overall signaling 

In order to introduce Idle/Acrtive ratio into all these UEs, we classify a part of all UEs into active/idle in advance
which means, these selected Users would keep in the same state all the time. For paging possiblity, a paging ratio is 
also introduced in a way that the UE would be paged randomly in each time interval. 

After all the preparation, then comes the implementation in several steps:
1, UE appears firstly in the city, then Procedure "Initial Attachment" would be conducted
2, For each time stemp, judge each existent UE, if each of them is in idle state or active state, then different 
further steps will be made as below.
3.1 If UE is in active state, then no periodic paging, only Handover with TAU exists when UE enters into a new TA 
which not belongs to original TAL.
3.2 If UE is in idle state, then periodic paging is considered in each time interval. Other than that, normal cell
reselection with TAU procedureand TAL reselection is conducted also. 

In each time stemp, total cost(not just separate cost for S-GW/P-GW/MME) including TAU & Paging is calculated 
dependent of its TAL allocation scheme. This mechanism is used several times in order to get an optimized TAL
scheme. 
How to calculate "total cost"?
1, we use a struct: cost.time_n.* (* represents a set of parameters like: total_cost, eNB_cost, MME_cost, SGW_cost
PGW_cost, PCFR_cost).**(** represents either messages per second or bytes per second)
2, For each 'handover with TAU'/Paging/periodic TAU/'cell reselection with TAU', we calculate the overall cost for both different 
network entities and sum of them in each time interval
